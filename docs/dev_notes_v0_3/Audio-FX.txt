Procedural Soundscapes: Generate ambient sounds dynamically (e.g., cafeteria chatter volume changes).

AI-TTS Voice Pack Manager: Integrate open TTS models so users can assign voices to characters.

Environmental Audio Zones: Volume/filters change when scene camera moves (e.g., echo in gym).

Adaptive Music: Background tracks shift with emotion tone or dialogue sentiment.

SFX Chaining: Combine multiple sound layers (e.g., footsteps + echo + prop movement) for realism.
Alignment Sidecars: `/api/tts/speak` now emits `alignment.json` + optional `lipsync.json` alongside cached WAVs for lip rigs.
Mixer Cache Hooks: `/api/audio/mix` accepts per-track gain/duck settings and stores `mix.json` diagnostics for modders to tweak stems before final exports.
