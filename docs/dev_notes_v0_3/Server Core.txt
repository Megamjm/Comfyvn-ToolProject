Goal: Increase automation and user control over rendering and data flow.

Ideas

Batch Chat Importer: Import entire conversation folders from SillyTavern automatically and tag them by arc or character.

Smart Scene Builder: Uses emotion + world context to suggest camera angles and sprite framing.

Auto Scene Diffing: Compare two scene JSONs and highlight differences in characters, emotions, or backgrounds.

Render Queue Prioritization: Let users set job priority (story scenes vs previews vs dumps).

API Bridge for Extensions: Open endpoint hooks so modders can inject their own pre/post-processing steps.
