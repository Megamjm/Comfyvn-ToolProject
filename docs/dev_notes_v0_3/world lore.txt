Goal: Expand immersion and cross-world reusability.

Ideas

Lore-based Lighting Profiles: Day/night cycles automatically apply via world metadata.

Dynamic Weather States: Rain, fog, snow, or wind triggered by story cues or emotion intensity.

Culture Rulesets: Worlds define clothing codes, architecture, and music styles to maintain consistency.

Parallel Worlds: Allow simultaneous “world layers” (e.g., dream vs real) for dual-scene transitions.

GeoNodes: Map-based lore system—characters and scenes tagged by coordinates in world data.
