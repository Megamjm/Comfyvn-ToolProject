Goal: Ensure every visual stays true to character and world.

Ideas

Auto-LoRA Versioning: Track LoRA updates with project snapshots to prevent mismatches.

LoRA Strength Blending: Blend between two LoRAs for hybrid character styles (e.g., serious â†’ playful).

Visual QA System: Compare generated sprites against reference LoRA samples to ensure consistency.

Character DNA Profiles: Auto-train micro-LoRAs for high-frequency characters.

Prompt Normalization Engine: Clean and rewrite prompts to ensure reproducibility across sessions.
