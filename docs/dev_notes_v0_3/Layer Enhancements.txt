Goal: Make the interface feel like an integrated VN studio rather than just a launcher.

Ideas

Scene Flow Graph View: Node-based editor (like ComfyUI) for visualizing and rearranging story routes.

Live Render Preview: Small viewport that shows each sceneâ€™s composite (sprites, props, BG).

Asset Drag-and-Drop: Drop an image or LoRA directly into the GUI to auto-register it.

Performance Overlay: Realtime resource usage meter (CPU/GPU/RAM) so users can adjust render modes easily.

Narrative Timeline: A horizontal bar that displays key plot points and scene jumps.
