Goal: Maximize asset reusability and render consistency.

Ideas

Pose Library System: Store reusable poses that can be applied across characters.

Sprite Layer Debugger: Visual preview showing how each render layer stacks (BG, props, character, FX).

Texture Compression Profiles: Optimize different asset types automatically for performance tiers.

Crowd Generator: Randomize faceless NPCs by scene type (school, street, office).

Camera Focus Simulation: Add depth blur on background characters during dialogue focus.
