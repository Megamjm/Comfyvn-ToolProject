# Troubleshooting
- Ensure ComfyUI at `COMFY_HOST` is running.
- Download required models listed in each preset and place into ComfyUI `models/`.
- For low VRAM, use Wan 2.2 5B preset and lower resolution/steps.
- If gallery thumbnail missing, use **Ingest PNG** to pair a render to its sidecar.
- Delete `.venv` if pip issues, then relaunch.
